# Data_base
Creation of a new ACI data base
The main objective is to create a new data base combining aerosols and clouds properties colocalized in space and time, based on different Aerosol-Cloud situations : 
Aerosol-Above-Cloud and Above Boundary Layer
Aerosol-Above-Cloud and Below Boundary Layer
Aerosol in Clear Sky (or around the clouds) and Below Boundary Layer

We're using data from TROPOMI (on board the satellite Sentinel-5P), MODIS (L2 product at native resolution) and reanalysis from CAMS (ERA5 and EAC4)
The covered period goes from 2019 to 2023 and the spatial resolution is 0.022°x0.022° (the TROPOMI resolution, to avoid any information lost)
